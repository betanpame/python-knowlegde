Generated automatically by `generate_progress.py`.

## 1. Snapshot Summary

Definitions:

- Created Test: Folder with markdown created (counts toward curriculum build-out)
- Python File: At least one `*.py` file exists for that test (implementation started)
- Status Keywords (first non-empty line of primary `.py` file):
    - `# TODO:` → Implementation not started / placeholder
    - `# RESOLVED:` → Implementation written but not yet validated
    - `# VALIDATED:` → Implementation written & validated
- Resolved Test: Leading keyword is `# RESOLVED:` or `# VALIDATED:` (Validated is a subset)
- Validated Test: Leading keyword is `# VALIDATED:` and passes heuristic checks (in future)


| Topic | Created | Python Files | Resolved | Validated | Remaining (Created) | Created % | Python File % | Resolved % | Validated % |
|-------|---------|--------------|----------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|---------------|------------|-------------|

| ControlFlow | 20 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 15% | 0% | 0% |
| DataScience | 7 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 13 | 35% | 5% | 0% | 0% |
| FileOperations | 20 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 5% | 0% | 0% |
| Functions | 20 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 10% | 0% | 0% |
| Lists | 20 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 25% | 0% | 0% |
| Modules | 20 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 5% | 0% | 0% |
| OOP | 20 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 5% | 0% | 0% |
| String | 20 | 20 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 100% | 100% | 5% | 5% |
| Tuples | 20 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 5% | 0% | 0% |
| WebTechnologies | 8 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 12 | 40% | 5% | 0% | 0% |

**Overall Created Progress:** 185 / 220 = **84.1%**

**Overall Python File Coverage:** 37 / 220 = **16.8%**

**Overall Resolved Progress:** 1 / 220 = **0.5%**

**Overall Validated Progress:** 1 / 220 = **0.5%**

Status Breakdown (by leading keyword in primary `.py` files):

- TODO: 36
- RESOLVED: 0
- VALIDATED: 1
- UNCATEGORIZED: 0

Transition Funnel (files): Created → Python File (37) → Resolved (1) → Validated (1)


_No heuristic warnings._
