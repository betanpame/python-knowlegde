# Simple While Loops - Test 5

**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê (Very Easy)

**Related Topics:** While Loops, Loop Conditions, Counters

## Objectives

- Learn basic while loop syntax
- Practice loop conditions and counters
- Understand when to use while vs for loops

## Description

Master while loops for situations where you need to repeat code until a condition becomes false. While loops are perfect for unknown iteration counts.

## Examples

```python
result = countdown_from(5)
print(result)  # [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

number = find_first_multiple_of_7_above(20)
print(number)  # 21
```

## Your Tasks

1. **countdown_from(start)** - Count down from start to 1
2. **count_up_to(limit)** - Count from 1 up to limit
3. **find_first_multiple_of_7_above(n)** - Find first multiple of 7 greater than n
4. **double_until_over(start, limit)** - Keep doubling start until over limit
5. **guess_the_number_game(target)** - Simple number guessing simulation
6. **accumulate_until_sum(numbers, target_sum)** - Add numbers until sum reached
7. **repeat_string_until_length(text, target_length)** - Repeat until length reached
8. **wait_for_condition_simulation()** - Simulate waiting for condition

Remember: While loops continue until condition becomes False!
