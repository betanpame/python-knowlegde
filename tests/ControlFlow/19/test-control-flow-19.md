# Complex System Control Logic - Test 19

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Medium)

**Related Topics:** System Design, Complex Logic, Enterprise Control Flow

## Objectives

- Design complex system control logic
- Handle enterprise-level control flow scenarios
- Implement sophisticated decision-making systems

## Description

Design and implement complex control systems that handle multiple interacting components, real-time decision making, and sophisticated business logic.

## Examples

```python
# Complex system orchestration
class SystemOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.services = {}
        self.dependencies = {}
        self.health_monitors = {}
    
    def orchestrate_system_startup(self, service_configs):
        # Complex startup sequence with dependencies
        pass
    
    def handle_system_failure(self, failed_service):
        # Sophisticated failure recovery
        pass
```

## Your Tasks

1. **SystemOrchestrator** - Complete system orchestration framework
2. **ComplexWorkflowEngine** - Multi-stage workflow processing
3. **AdaptiveDecisionSystem** - Self-adjusting decision logic
4. **RealTimeEventProcessor** - Process events with complex rules
5. **DistributedLockManager** - Manage distributed resource locks
6. **ComplexValidationFramework** - Multi-level data validation
7. **SystemHealthMonitor** - Monitor and respond to system health
8. **BusinessRuleEngine** - Execute complex business rules

## System Requirements

- Handle thousands of concurrent operations
- Support complex dependency management
- Implement fault tolerance and recovery
- Provide real-time monitoring and alerts
- Support dynamic configuration changes

## Enterprise Features

- Multi-tenant operation support
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Performance metrics and optimization
- Security and access control integration
- Scalable architecture patterns

Remember: Enterprise systems require robust, maintainable control flow!
