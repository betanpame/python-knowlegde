# Test String 20: Advanced Text Processing and Analysis

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Hard)

**Related Topics:** String algorithms, text analysis, performance optimization, complex patterns

## Objective

Implement sophisticated text processing algorithms including pattern matching, text similarity, and linguistic analysis using only built-in string methods.

## Requirements

Create a comprehensive text analysis system that can:
1. Find longest common subsequences between texts
2. Calculate text similarity metrics
3. Perform advanced pattern matching and extraction
4. Analyze text structure and readability
5. Handle large text processing efficiently

## Example

```python
analyzer = AdvancedTextAnalyzer()
similarity = analyzer.calculate_similarity("python programming", "python coding")
patterns = analyzer.extract_patterns("Phone: 555-1234, Email: test@email.com")
readability = analyzer.analyze_readability("This is a sample text for analysis.")
```

## Hints

- Use dynamic programming concepts with string operations
- Implement efficient algorithms for pattern matching
- Consider text preprocessing and normalization
- Handle edge cases like empty texts and special characters
- Optimize for performance with large texts

## Test Cases

1. Text similarity between various document pairs
2. Pattern extraction from mixed content
3. Readability analysis of different complexity texts
4. Performance testing with large text samples
5. Edge cases with special characters and formatting
