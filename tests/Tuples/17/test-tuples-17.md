# Advanced Tuple Data Processing - Test 17

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Medium)

**Related Topics:** Advanced Processing, Complex Analytics, Data Science

## Objectives

- Implement sophisticated tuple processing algorithms
- Handle complex data analytics scenarios
- Optimize for large-scale tuple operations

## Description

Tackle advanced tuple processing challenges that require sophisticated algorithms and data analysis techniques for real-world applications.

## Examples

```python
# Complex financial data as tuples
transactions = [
    ("2023-01-15", "AAPL", "BUY", 100, 150.25),
    ("2023-01-16", "GOOGL", "SELL", 50, 2800.50),
    ("2023-01-17", "AAPL", "SELL", 50, 152.00)
]

# Advanced analytics
portfolio = analyze_portfolio_performance(transactions)
risk_metrics = calculate_risk_metrics(transactions)
```
