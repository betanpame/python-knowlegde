# Study Progress Report (20-08-2025)

> Legacy Note: Current progress and completion artifacts now live under the root `progress/` directory (previously `docs/progress/`). This file is retained for historical reference.

This document captures your current progress across all Python knowledge topics and provides a replicable procedure to regenerate and update progress in future study sessions.

## 1. Snapshot Summary

Definitions:

- Created Practice: Folder with markdown created (counts toward curriculum build-out)
- Python File: A `*.py` file exists for that test (implementation started)
- Status Keywords (first non-empty line of `.py` file):
    - `# TODO:` → Implementation not started / still placeholder
    - `# RESOLVED:` → Implementation written but not yet validated against rubric/test criteria
    - `# VALIDATED:` → Implementation written and manually (or automatically) validated
- Resolved Practice: `.py` file whose leading keyword is either `# RESOLVED:` or `# VALIDATED:` (Validated is a superset)
- Validated Practice: `.py` file whose leading keyword is `# VALIDATED:` and (future heuristic) passes quality checks (no lingering TODO/pass placeholders)


| Topic | Created | Python Files | Resolved | Validated | Remaining (Created) | Created % | Python File % | Resolved % | Validated % |
|-------|---------|--------------|----------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| BuiltinFunctions | 10 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 50% | 10% | 0% | 0% |
| ControlFlow | 20 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 15% | 0% | 0% |
| DataScience | 7 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 13 | 35% | 14% | 0% | 0% |
| FileOperations | 20 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 5% | 0% | 0% |
| Functions | 20 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 10% | 0% | 0% |
| Lists | 20 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 25% | 0% | 0% |
| Modules | 20 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 5% | 0% | 0% |
| OOP | 20 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 5% | 0% | 0% |
| String | 20 | 20 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 100% | 100% | 5% | 5% |
| Tuples | 20 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 100% | 5% | 0% | 0% |
| WebTechnologies | 8 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 12 | 40% | 12% | 0% | 0% |

**Overall Created Progress:** 185 / 220 = **84.1%**

**Overall Python File Coverage:** 37 / 220 = **16.8%**

Status Breakdown (by leading keyword in `.py` files):

- TODO: 36
- RESOLVED: 0
- VALIDATED: 1
- Uncategorized: 0

**Overall Resolved Progress:** 1 / 220 = **0.5%**

**Overall Validated Progress:** 1 / 220 = **0.5%**

Implementation Maturity (Validated / Created): 1 / 185 = **0.5%**

Transition Funnel (files): Created → Python File (37) → Resolved (1) → Validated (1)

> Focus Areas: 1) Finish creating remaining tests (Builtins, DataScience, WebTechnologies) 2) Migrate existing `.py` headers from `# TODO:` → `# RESOLVED:` when logic added, then `# VALIDATED:` after review/testing; 3) Add an automated script to regenerate these keyword stats.

### Status Advancement Checklist

| Stage | Action Required | Keyword Change |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| TODO → RESOLVED | Implement core functions (remove placeholder passes) | Replace leading `# TODO:` with `# RESOLVED:` |
| RESOLVED → VALIDATED | Run manual/automated tests; ensure no TODO/placeholder logic remains | Replace leading `# RESOLVED:` with `# VALIDATED:` |
| VALIDATED (maintain) | Keep code updated if spec changes | Keep keyword; revalidate on changes |

Heuristic for future automation (planned):

1. Detect leading keyword.
2. Flag contradictions (e.g., `# VALIDATED:` but file still contains `# TODO:` later).
3. Count meaningful implementation lines (exclude comments/blank) to guard against empty RESOLVED claims.
4. Optional: integrate simple runtime smoke practices per topic.

Adjust pacing if a session is longer/shorter.

---

## 4. Regenerating This Progress File (Replicable Procedure)

You can recreate an updated progress file any time with the following reproducible steps.

### A. Manual Method

1. Go to the `tests` directory.
2. For each topic folder (e.g., `BuiltinFunctions`), count the numeric subfolders (1..20).
3. Mark which indices exist (completed) and which are missing (remaining).
4. Compute completion percentage: `(completed / 20) * 100`.
5. Sum totals across all topics for overall completion.
6. Create a new file in `progress/` named: `progressDD_MM_YYYY.md`.
7. Fill sections: Summary Table, Topic Breakdown, Roadmap.

### B. Semi-Automated (Python Script)

Create a script (e.g., `generate_progress.py`) at repository root:

```python
import os, datetime, textwrap

TOPICS = [d for d in os.listdir('tests') if os.path.isdir(os.path.join('tests', d)) and d != 'README.md']
TOTAL_PER_TOPIC = 20

def collect():
    data = []
    total_done = 0
    total_all = TOTAL_PER_TOPIC * len(TOPICS)
    for topic in sorted(TOPICS):
        path = os.path.join('tests', topic)
        done = [name for name in os.listdir(path) if name.isdigit()]
        done_count = len(done)
        total_done += done_count
        data.append((topic, done_count, TOTAL_PER_TOPIC - done_count, done))
    return data, total_done, total_all

def generate():
    data, total_done, total_all = collect()
    now = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%d-%m-%Y')
    lines = []
    lines.append(f"# Study Progress Report ({now})\n")
    lines.append("| Topic | Completed Practices | Remaining | Completion % |")
    lines.append("|-------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|")
    for topic, done_count, remaining, _ in data:
        pct = (done_count / TOTAL_PER_TOPIC) * 100
        lines.append(f"| {topic} | {done_count} / {TOTAL_PER_TOPIC} | {remaining} | {pct:.0f}% |")
    overall_pct = (total_done / total_all) * 100
    lines.append(f"\n**Overall Progress:** {total_done} / {total_all} = **{overall_pct:.1f}% complete**\n")
    # Simple focus suggestion
    backlog = sorted([ (topic, rem) for topic, _, rem, _ in data if rem>0], key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    if backlog:
        lines.append("### Suggested Focus Order\n")
        for topic, rem in backlog:
            lines.append(f"- {topic}: {rem} remaining")
    filename = f"progress/progress{now.replace('-', '_')}.md"
    os.makedirs('doc', exist_ok=True)
    with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write('\n'.join(lines))
    print(f"Progress written to {filename}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    generate()
```

Run:

```bash
python generate_progress.py
```

This will create/update a dated progress file.

### C. PowerShell One-Liner (Quick Count on Windows)

From repo root in PowerShell:

```powershell
$topics = Get-ChildItem tests -Directory | Where-Object { $_.Name -ne 'README.md' }
$totalDone = 0; $totalAll = $topics.Count * 20
$lines = @('| Topic | Completed | Remaining | % |','|-------|-----------|-----------|---|')
foreach ($t in $topics) {
  $done = (Get-ChildItem $t.FullName -Directory | Where-Object { $_.Name -match '^[0-9]+$' }).Count
  $totalDone += $done
  $pct = [math]::Round(($done/20)*100)
  $lines += "| $($t.Name) | $done / 20 | $(20-$done) | $pct% |"
}
$overall = [math]::Round(($totalDone/$totalAll)*100,1)
$today = Get-Date -Format 'dd_MM_yyyy'
@("# Study Progress Report ($today)", $lines, "", "Overall: $totalDone / $totalAll ($overall% )") | Out-File "progress/progress$today.md" -Encoding utf8
```

### D. Git Alias (Optional)

Add to your global `.gitconfig` for quick diff-based progress (counts added folders):

```ini
[alias]
progress = !python generate_progress.py && git add progress/progress$(date +%d_%m_%Y).md
```
(Adjust for Windows using a bash-compatible environment like Git Bash.)

## 5. Progress Trends (Planning Guidance)

- Maintain momentum by finishing one partially complete topic before context-switching.
- Alternate between cognitive loads: after heavy DataScience session, do WebTechnologies to vary skill domain.
- Use capstone (e.g., WebTechnologies test 20) as reference quality for intermediate tests.

---

## 6. Definition of Done (Per Practice)

- Folder exists: `tests/<Topic>/<n>/`
- Markdown file includes: Description, Objectives, Tasks, Examples, Hints, Practice Cases, Bonus
- (If applicable) `.py` runnable example present
- Content follows progressive difficulty taxonomy

---

## 7. Next Immediate Actions

1. BuiltinFunctions test 11 (execution & compilation functions: `eval`, `exec`, `compile` safety patterns)
2. BuiltinFunctions test 12 (numeric/iterator helpers: `sum`, `min`, `max`, `sorted`, `reversed` advanced usage)
3. BuiltinFunctions test 13 (functional tools: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `partial` + comprehension comparisons)

---

## 8. How to Log Each Session

Template to append in a personal log (optional):

```text
### Session YYYY-MM-DD (Duration: XhYm)
Focus: <topic/tests>
Added: BuiltinFunctions 11, 12
Notes: Learned about compile() safety wrappers.
Next: Finish BuiltinFunctions 13–15
```

---

## 9. Automation Extensions (Future Ideas)

- Add test content validator script (check required sections exist)
- Generate a JSON progress file for dashboard visualization
- Integrate badge generation for README (dynamic progress shield)
- Track average tests per session to project completion date

---

## 10. Changelog for This Snapshot

- Added BuiltinFunctions test 10 today (Memory & Performance Functions)
- Generated this progress report

---

## 11. Closing

You're 84% done—entering refinement phase. Prioritize breadth completion (finish remaining topics) before deep enhancements.

"Consistency compounds: finish a vertical slice each session."
