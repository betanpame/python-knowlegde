# Practice Web Technologies 1: Web Scraping and API Interactions

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (Medium-Hard)

**Related Topics:** requests, BeautifulSoup, urllib, web scraping, API consumption

## Objective

Master web technologies for data extraction, including web scraping and API interactions.

## Requirements

Implement functions that demonstrate web technologies:

1. `download_image_from_url(url, filename)` - Download images using urllib.request
2. `scrape_movie_data(url)` - Scrape IMDb-style movie data
3. `api_data_fetcher(api_url, **params)` - Generic API data fetcher
4. `web_content_analyzer(url)` - Analyze webpage content
5. `batch_url_processor(urls)` - Process multiple URLs efficiently

## Libraries to Use

- **urllib.request**: Built-in module for basic web requests and file downloads
- **requests**: More user-friendly HTTP library for API calls
- **BeautifulSoup**: HTML/XML parsing and data extraction
- **json**: Handle API responses

## Examples

```python
# Image download
url = "https://example.com/image.jpg"
download_image_from_url(url, "downloaded_image.jpg")

# Movie scraping
movies = scrape_movie_data("https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/")
# Should extract: title, year, rating for top movies
```

## Hints

- Use `urllib.request.urlretrieve()` for downloading files
- Use `requests.get()` for making HTTP requests
- Use `BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')` for parsing HTML
- Always include proper headers to avoid being blocked
- Handle network errors and timeouts gracefully
- Respect robots.txt and rate limiting

## Important Notes

- These tests work with mock/sample data for safety
- Real web scraping should respect website terms of service
- Some websites require authentication or have anti-scraping measures
- Always test with small datasets first

## Practice Cases

Your functions should handle:

1. Valid URLs with successful downloads
2. Invalid URLs and network errors
3. Different image formats and sizes
4. HTML parsing with missing elements
5. API responses with different structures
