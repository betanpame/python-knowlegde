# Practice Tuples 1: Tuple Immutability and Methods

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐☆☆☆ (Easy-Medium)

**Related Topics:** Tuple immutability, tuple methods, tuple vs list differences

## Objective

Understand tuple immutability and learn to work with tuple methods effectively.

## Requirements

Create functions that demonstrate tuple operations and the differences between tuples and lists:

1. `analyze_coordinates(coordinates)` - Given a tuple of (x, y) coordinates, return analysis
2. `count_occurrences(data_tuple, element)` - Count occurrences using tuple methods
3. `find_element_position(data_tuple, element)` - Find first position of element
4. `demonstrate_immutability()` - Show why tuples can't be modified
5. `tuple_vs_list_comparison()` - Compare tuple and list operations

## Example

```python
coordinates = (3, 4, 3, 7, 4, 3)
analysis = analyze_coordinates(coordinates)
# Expected output: {
#     'total_points': 3,
#     'unique_x_coords': [3, 4, 7],
#     'most_common_x': 3,
#     'average_x': 4.0
# }
```

## Hints

- Use `.count()` method for counting elements
- Use `.index()` method for finding positions
- Remember tuples are immutable - you can't change them
- Convert to list for modifications, then back to tuple if needed
- Tuples are faster than lists for read-only operations

## Practice Cases

Your functions should handle:

1. Empty tuples
2. Tuples with duplicate elements
3. Tuples with single elements
4. Attempting to modify tuples (should raise errors)
5. Performance comparison between tuples and lists
