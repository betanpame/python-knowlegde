# Advanced Tuple Operations - Practice 13

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐ (Easy-Medium)

**Related Topics:** Complex Operations, Tuple Algorithms, Data Processing

## Description

Implement advanced operations and algorithms specifically designed for tuple data structures.

## Your Tasks

1. **merge_multiple_tuples(*tuples)** - Merge any number of tuples
2. **tuple_set_operations(tuple1, tuple2)** - Union, intersection, difference
3. **flatten_nested_tuples(nested_tuple)** - Flatten nested structure
4. **rotate_tuple_elements(my_tuple, positions)** - Rotate elements
5. **tuple_zip_operations(tuple1, tuple2)** - Zip tuples together
6. **find_tuple_patterns(my_tuple, pattern)** - Find pattern occurrences
7. **tuple_statistical_analysis(numeric_tuple)** - Calculate statistics
8. **convert_tuple_to_matrix(my_tuple, rows, cols)** - Reshape to 2D structure

Remember: Focus on immutability and efficient algorithms!
