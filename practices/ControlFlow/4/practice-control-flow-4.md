# Simple For Loops - Practice 4

**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê (Very Easy)

**Related Topics:** For Loops, Iteration, Range Function

## Objectives

- Learn basic for loop syntax and usage
- Practice iterating over sequences
- Understand the range() function

## Description

Master the fundamental for loop structure for iterating over sequences and ranges. For loops are essential for processing collections of data.

## Examples

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = sum_numbers(numbers)
print(total)  # 15

result = count_to_ten()
print(result)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

## Your Tasks

1. **sum_numbers(numbers)** - Sum all numbers in a list using for loop
2. **count_to_ten()** - Create list of numbers 1-10 using for loop
3. **print_each_character(text)** - Print each character on separate line
4. **count_vowels(text)** - Count vowels in text using for loop
5. **multiply_by_index(numbers)** - Multiply each number by its index
6. **find_longest_word(words)** - Find longest word in list
7. **create_squares_list(n)** - Create list of squares from 1 to n
8. **reverse_each_word(words)** - Reverse each word in list

Remember: For loops make processing sequences simple and readable!
